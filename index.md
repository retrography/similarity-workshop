The increasing availability of digital trace data and recent advances on both methods and tools to analyze data in unprecedented scale opens up new venues for information systems research. These trends permit the implementation of novel analysis methods and open up new arenas for theorization. Yet, the sheer volume of data means that the traditional research methods, whether qualitative or quantitative, may not be able to fully benefit from the depth and the breadth of the data available. That is unless the data is made accessible through intermediary transformation steps. Traditionally this accessibility has been achieved by limiting the scale of the data through sampling strategies. But advances in computational methods have made other strategies possible that may provide additional or holistic insights. Among others, these methods include dimensionality reduction methods used to “summarize” the data by focusing on its salient features and the methods capable of detecting patterns and similarities at a large scale. The combination of these computationally-powered tools with traditional research methods open new possibilities for both inductive and deductive research.

This workshop focuses on similarity detection methods. An interactive workshop will be held where the participants will have the chance to use similarity detection methods on precollected data. The workshop will include presentations and interactive sessions focusing on the following methods:

- Fuzzy hashing for text similarity detection (Mahmood Shafeie Zargar).
- Spherical harmonic representation of 3D shapes for product design comparison (Harris Kyriakou).
- Semantic transformations with ontology extraction using Wikipedia (Yegin Genc).
